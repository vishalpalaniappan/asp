This section is in being reworked because the information it had was outdated.

In the mean time, please see these PR's for some more insight:
[PR #22](https://github.com/vishalpalaniappan/asp-query-server/pull/22)

[PR #25](https://github.com/vishalpalaniappan/asp-query-server/pull/25), 

In the current version of this program, the system_logs folder contains all the log files belonging to the current system. In the future, once CDL log files are ingested by CLP, the features CLP provides will be used to improve the performance of this system.
